Word Frequency Counter

This repository contains a simple web application that analyzes the frequency of words inputted by a user. The application dynamically creates user interface elements using the DOM API and processes text to display the most frequent words and their counts.

Project Overview

The core functionality of this application is to allow users to input a block of text into a textarea. Upon submitting the text, the application tokenizes the input, calculates the frequency of each word, and then displays the top five most frequent words along with their frequencies in a table format. This project is an excellent exercise in understanding and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.

Features
1) Dynamic UI creation with JavaScript
2) Text tokenization and frequency analysis
3) Sorting and displaying results in a user-friendly format
   
Technologies Used
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JavaScript

   
Learning Journey

Building this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, particularly in DOM manipulation and event handling. Implementing the logic to analyze the text introduced me to more complex aspects of JavaScript like array manipulations and object property iterations. The challenge of dynamically creating elements and appending them to the DOM was particularly enriching and improved my skills in crafting interactive web pages.

Setup and Deployment

The application is hosted using GitHub Pages and can be accessed at https://ritesh00007.github.io/Assignment-6/.
